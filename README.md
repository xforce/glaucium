## Code Quality...Sucks

The current quality of the code is rather bad (imo)  
I have nerver used go until i started this project and the primary goal was/is  
to get a working version out and then worry about cleaning up the code

## Special Thanks

- To Mozilla for creating [Socorro](https://github.com/mozilla/socorro),
  which served as a great inspiration and resource for this project,
  some parts are currently directly based on Socorro's implementation
  (mainly the processor and filesystem storage)
